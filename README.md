## Setup project

Create a `.env.local` file in the root (same place as package.json)

Add the connection string to `.env.local`, replace <ask for connection string> with the connection string.

```
MONGODB_URI="<ask for connection string>"
```

### Install Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

Run `ollama pull openhermes`

### Optional

If you use nvmrc that is recommended, run `nvm use` to get the correct Node version.

### Run

`npm ci` - to install dependencies

`npm run dev`

You should see:
`Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!` once you are connected to DB succesfully.

Url is `localhost:3000`
